# Distance Transform benchmark

This repository contains the source code to compute the generalised geodesic
distance transform on GPU.

**NB: This source code requires at least CUDA Drivers 12.8.**. In order to run
it, it is recommended to use the
[devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)
provided with the source code.

## How to use it

This repository provides a `devcontainer` to ensure a common development
environment. Once the container is launched, you can run the test using the
following commands:

```
$ cmake --preset debug
$ cmake --build --preset debug
$ ctest --preset debug
```

A `release` preset is also provided for optimized build of the library.

It has to be noted that the devcontainer uses `clangd` as a C++ LSP. It uses the
`compile_commands.json` generated by the `debug` presets so in order to develop,
it is recommanded to use the `debug` preset.
