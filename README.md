# Distance Transform benchmark

This repository is currently in development in order to provide a benchmark on
distance transform.

## How to use it

This repository provides a `devcontainer` to ensure a common development
environment. Once the container is launched, you can run the test using the
following commands:

```
$ cmake --preset debug
$ cmake --build --preset debug
$ ctest --preset debug
```

A `release` preset is also provided for optimized build of the library.

It has to be noted that the devcontainer uses `clangd` as a C++ LSP. It uses the
`compile_commands.json` generated by the `debug` presets so in order to develop,
it is recommanded to use the `debug` preset.

Experimental Python bindings are in development with Pytorch. To build the
module, execute the following command:

```
$ uv build
```
